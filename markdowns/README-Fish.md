# Overview of Analyses

In this analysis, we investigate species diversity, community composition, and species associations between two sites: Mount Hartman (MH) and Westerhall (WH). The data do not conform to a bell-shaped curve, suggesting potential non-normality. However, since the tests employed do not assume normality, this is not a primary concern.

## Species Diversity

To assess differences in species diversity between MH and WH, we computed richness, Shannon Weiner, and Simpson indices for both sites. A Welch Two Sample t-test was conducted for each diversity metric.

### Results:
- **Richness:** Significant difference observed between MH and WH (p = 0.0038).
- **Shannon-Weiner:** Significant difference observed between MH and WH (p = 0.0336).
- **Simpson:** Marginally non-significant difference observed between MH and WH (p = 0.0746).

## Community Composition

To evaluate differences in community composition, we used the MRPP (Multi-Response Permutation Procedure) test due to an unbalanced design resulting from some replicates having no observations. The test was performed based on abundance and biomass data.

### Results:
- **Abundance-based MRPP:** No significant difference observed (p = 0.127, A = 0.0073).
- **Biomass-based MRPP:** No significant difference observed (p = 0.415, A = -0.00049).

## Species Associations

Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) was conducted to identify species associated with either site.

### Results:
- **Abundance-based ISA:** No species exhibited significant associations.
- **Biomass-based ISA:** No species exhibited significant associations.

Overall, while significant differences were observed in richness and Shannon Weiner diversity indices, no significant disparities were found in community composition or species associations between MH and WH.
