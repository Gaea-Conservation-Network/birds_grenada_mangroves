# The value of mangrove ecosystems in Grenada for resident and migratory birds
Here, we describe the bird communities observed in four wetlands on Grenada, surveyed in 2020.
 
Data collection protocols:

Bird surveys were conducted between Feb and May 2020 at the four sites. Surveys started between 7 am and 12 pm, and environmental conditions (wind, rain, cloud cover) were recorded on arrival. 8-minute point counts were done by one person using a radius of 25 m. In-transit counts were also done where appropriate. 

Vegetation surveys were done in May and June 2020. Within each plot, observers recorded the species of mangrove present and their abundance by size class. One representative tree from each species and size class was chosen for more in-depth measurements. Water quality parameters (salinity, conductivity, etc.) were also measured where there was standing water in the plots.
